## What is ONEAL?

The Open Negotiation Education for Academic Libraries (ONEAL) project is a collaboration between Indiana University Purdue University-Indianapolis, Grand Valley State University, and Belmont University to develop curricula and open educational resources to support negotiation education for academic libraries and Master of Library Science (MLS/MLIS) programs. These resources introduce negotiation theory and practical strategy using academic library context of negotiating vendor agreements. 

The open curriculum will include introductions to critical issues in academic libraries as they intersect with contract negotiations such as user privacy, platform governance, emerging publishing models, author rights, and computational collections research.  

The project team maintains a guide with additional information [via IUPUI](https://iupui.libguides.com/ONEAL).

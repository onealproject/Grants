## Pilot Testing 

The ONEAL Project (Open Negotiation Education for Academic Libraries) solicits a group of curious and active pilot testers for our community-driven, open negotiations curriculum. Pilot testers can be library professionals and MLS/MLIS students.

**What is the ONEAL Project?**

The ONEAL Project is a collaboration between Indiana University–Purdue University Indianapolis, Grand Valley State University, and Belmont University to develop OER in support of teaching negotiation for continued professional development in academic libraries and graduate library science programs This OER will include negotiation theory and strategy, using the academic library context of vendor license and contract agreements, built on real-world scenarios from the community.

**When**

The pilot will run from October 1 - November 30, with a follow up focus group in early December. 

What will the pilot participants do?

- Complete asynchronous learning modules.
- Interact with others in the course through the ONEAL Project Discord server.
- Opportunities for discussion and optional group activities as part of curriculum design.
- Reflection to provide input and feedback.

Application: https://gvsu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_ewCmNacHvh95I0e

Primary funding for the ONEAL Project is provided by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). 

Pilot testers who provide feedback on the curriculum modules will receive an honorarium of $500. Applicants will be notified no later than September 15, 2023. Please apply by September 8, 2023 for best consideration. 

Please reach out to [Katharine Macy](mailto:macyk@iupui.edu) with any questions. The project team maintains a guide with additional information at https://iupui.libguides.com/ONEAL

## Collaborators 

As the curriculum takes shape, we'll issue calls for collaborators. Stipends are available, and can be funded for content as well as design elements.  

One of the commitments we’ve made is to cite as much existing work as possible by BIPOC colleagues in the areas of library collections, licensing and negotiation, vendor relationships and project management. We can locate much of the literature, but new works are generated constantly. If this aligns with work you’ve done or work you’re aware of, please reach out to a member of the project team.

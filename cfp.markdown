ONEAL is currently wrapping up phase one of the project. Our team hosted several community forums and a curriculum design workshop. Our second phase focuses on individual interviews and analysis, and identifying needs for collaborators. 

## Collaborators 

As the curriculum takes shape, we'll issue calls for collaborators. Stipends are available, and can be funded for content as well as design elements.  

One of the commitments we’ve made is to cite as much existing work as possible by BIPOC colleagues in the areas of library collections, licensing and negotiation, vendor relationships and project management. We can locate much of the literature, but new works are generated constantly. If this aligns with work you’ve done or work you’re aware of, please reach out to a member of the project team. 

## Interviews

ONEAL seeks 20 academic library workers willing to share their experiences negotiating with vendors through a 60-minute interview in spring 2023. 

**The purpose of this study** is to identify key themes around the experiences of academic library workers and negotiating with vendors including challenges, strategies, and tactics. The transcripts of these interviews will undergo qualitative analysis to identify themes. These will inform fictionalized case studies and scenarios for Open Negotiation Education for Academic Libraries (ONEAL) Project curriculum.   

**What is the ONEAL Project?**

The Open Negotiation Education for Academic Libraries (ONEAL) Project is a collaboration between Indiana University Purdue University - Indianapolis, Grand Valley State University, and Belmont University to develop curricula and open educational resources in support of negotiation education for academic libraries and Master of Library Science (MLS/MLIS) programs. These resources introduce negotiation theory and practical strategy using the academic library context of negotiating vendor agreements. 

The open curriculum will include introductions to critical issues in academic libraries as they intersect with contract negotiations such as user privacy, emerging access models, author rights, and computational collections research.  

The project team maintains a guide with additional information at https://iupui.libguides.com/ONEAL

**Who is sponsoring this work?**

ONEAL is sponsored by the Institute of Museum and Library Services, Laura Bush 21st Century Librarian Program.
